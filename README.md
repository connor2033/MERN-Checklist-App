# Checkable

### Deployed at https://www.checkable.ca/

I created this custom checklist web app to make it easier for students like me to keep track of their tasks! 

With Checkable you can Create custom checklists, Share templates with large groups, Collaborate with peers on personal lists, or keep it private.

I went into this project with the aim of not requiring user accounts, and making it as easy and simple as possible to create a list. It's based on the MERN stack and deployed via Heroku.
