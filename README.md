# Checkable

### **Hosted at https://www.checkable.ca/**

I created this custom checklist web app to make it easier for students like me to keep track of their tasks!

With **Checkable** you can Create custom checklists, Share templates with large groups, Collaborate with peers on personal lists, or keep it private.

I went into this project with the aim of not requiring user accounts, and making it as easy and simple as possible to create a list. It's based on the **MERN** stack and deployed via Heroku.

## Deployment

**Note:** There is a .env file which is required as part of this project. However, it contains private information (MONGO_URI) and has therefore been excluded from this Git repository.

This will push the changes, make the build, and deploy to Heroku.
